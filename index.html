          <p>To solve a problem, you first have to understand the cause of it. We will look at the latest data around the world, compiled by <a href="https://www.workwithdata.com/datasets/countries" target=" _blank">workwithdata</href></a>, about 
          location, economy, press freedom, and gender distribution to find out whether or not these factors affect the suicide rate. </p>

          <h2>Location</h2>
          <p>We will first look at the location of countries to see if there is any correlation between it and the suicide rate. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">

          <p>From looking at these 2 graphs alone, one might conclude that Asia in general have a much lower suicide rate compare to other continents, holding the majority in the "lowest" graph, while Africa and Europe is much worse.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-1" style="margin-top: 15px">

        <div class="pure-u-1-1">
          <p>However, when looking at 2 bar charts with the world map, we can see a general pattern, barring a few exception:
             Asia, Africa and South America have lower suicide rate while first world countries and especially ex-Soviet, have higher rate.
            There could potentially be 2 explanation for this pattern. The first potential reason for this is countries with higher suicide rate have better documentation methods, leading to higher value.
          A second potential factor is social stress, as many ex-Soviet countries have a higher level of stress placed on their citizens.</p>

          <h2>Gender distribution</h2>
          <p>As we all know, gender equality is something many people fight for, but are not totally achieved, at least not yet. This could lead to potential suicide in female for being mistreated, or even too much stress placed on the male counterpart. </p>

        <div class="pure-u-1-1">
          <p>Surprisingly, in both categories of highest and lowest suicide rate, all countries have very similar distrubtion between male and female. This may indicate that gender is not the driving factor for suicide rate in any case. It should be noted, however, a lack of suicide by gender data means this conclusion is skewed and should be further researched about.</p>

          <h2>Social</h2>
          <p>We will now look at some of the social factor that may be able to affect the suicide rate of a country.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">

        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <div class="description description-right">
            <p>The theory behind why we look at this factor is countries with low press freedom may hide the suicide count to reduce civil unrest; or due to the instability of the country, suicide rate increase while the press freedom is reduced.</p>
            <p>However, after looking at the graph on the left, it is safe to say that press freedom does not have much effects on suicide rate as countries in both high and low press freedom yield similar suicide rate. It also can be seen that most countries have 
              low press freedom and low suicide rate; while some countries with high press freedom have higher than normal suicide rate (but this may due to better documentation).</p>

          <div class="description description-right">
            <p>The theory for this comes from the fact that Soviet society is extremely stressful with high death rate, maybe a higher democracy score will have lower suicide rate? </p>
            <p>However, again, similar to press freedom, there appear to be no correlation between it and suicide rate. Suicide rate spread relatively even throughout the democracy score.</p>

          <p>As we all know, money is a factor that can lead to a lot of stress. There are numerous case of suicide due to money pressure. </p>

            <p>From the data, there can is no relation to be drawn between economy and suicide rate as suicide rate is more or less the same for the whole range of GDP per capita and unemployment rate.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Although there seems to be no connection between any of the factors examined to the suicide rate of a country, further research into the social aspect of high suicide rate countries should be conducted as there can be seen hotspots where countries with high tensions to their neighbour.</p>
